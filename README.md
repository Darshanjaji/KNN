## KNN-algorithm
In this project we are doing the Handwriting classification problem.<br>
The model can able to predict the numbers from 1 to 10 which is written in hand.
This is a supervised machine learning model.<br>
##KNN steps<br>
1. Find the distance between new test point from all the train data set points <br>
   using equation d = sqrt((x1-x2)^2 + (y1-y2)^2).<br>
2. Sort the distance and get the first 5 distance and which class it belongs to in the list.<br>
3. Based on first 5 distance and class find which calss occured more number of time and return that class as the answer. 


This model has 97 accuracy.
